# 🕒 Timeline App

## 🚀 Project Goal

The Timeline App is a multi-stage web development project aimed at building an interactive, accessible, and visually structured application to showcase chronological events. This app will evolve from a semantic HTML skeleton into a fully interactive, accessible React-based single-page application.

---

## ✅ Task 1: HTML (Semantic Skeleton)

### 🎯 Outcome

Create a semantic and accessible static skeleton for the timeline app using HTML.

### 🔨 Deliverables

- Semantic HTML structure using:
  - `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section id="timeline">`, `<article>`, `<figure>`
- **Header** includes:
  - Project logo (`TimelineApp`)
  - A placeholder theme toggle control (🌙)
- **Nav**: Placeholder for future filters.
- **Main/Timeline Section**: Contains article placeholders for timeline event entries.
- **Modal Placeholder**: Empty `<div id="modal">` reserved for future pop-ups.
- **Accessibility**:
  - Proper landmark roles (`role="dialog"`, `aria-hidden`, etc.)
  - `alt` text on placeholder images
  - Logical content structure using semantic elements

### 🧪 How to Test

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Ensure:
   - All key structural tags are present
   - Placeholders render for header, nav, timeline section, and modal
   - Logo and theme toggle button are visible
   - Page structure is readable and accessible (screen reader friendly)
